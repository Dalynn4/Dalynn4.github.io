### (but the false can work sometimes, too)

One of the first concepts you learn in life is the difference between what is true and what is false. The same can be said for coding. Most coding languages come with a set of statements that are either TRUE or FALSE. 

In coding, *boolean* is the term that refers to a data type that has only two possible values: true or false. A *boolean expression* or *function* is a statement that produces a boolean value upon resolution.

In Ruby, the only FALSE values are *false* or *nil*. Every other value returns as TRUE. Knowing this, you can use your boolean operators, like "=="(equals) or "&&"(and) or "!"(not) or "|"(or), to evaluate statements to compare truthyness or falseyness. A lot of the basic functions you will perform in Ruby are based on whether you can evaluate a statement to be TRUE or FALSE. The basis of conditional statements(*if* and *elsif*) are checking whether a statement evalutates to be true, then ignoring or executing a line of code based on that.

As you can see, when learning to code in new language, it is imperative that you learn what that language identifes to be TRUE or FALSE.
