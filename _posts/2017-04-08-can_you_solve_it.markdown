A brain teaser for you......

*Cannibals in the jungle capture three men. The men are given one chance to escape with their lives. The men are lined up and bound to stakes such that one man can see the backs of the other two, the middle man can see the back of the front man, and the front man cannot see anybody. The men are shown five hats, three of which are black and two of which are white. Then the men are blindfolded, and one of the five hats is placed on each man’s head. The remaining two hats are hidden away. The blindfolds are removed. The men are told that if just one of the men can guess what hat he is wearing, they may all go free. Time passes. Finally, the front man, who cannot see anyone, correctly guesses the color of his hat. What color was it, and how did he guess correctly?*

Answer?

*The back man can see the hats worn by the two men in front of him. So, if both of those hats were white, he would know that the hat he wore was black. However, since he does not answer, he must see at least one black hat ahead of him. After it becomes apparent to the middle man that the back man cannot figure out what he is wearing, he knows that there is at least one black hat worn by himself and the front man. Knowing this, if the middle man saw a white hat in front of him, he would know that his own hat was black, and could answer the question correctly. But, since he does not answer, he must see a black hat on the front man. After it becomes apparent to the front man that neither of the men behind him can answer the question, he realizes the middle man saw a black hat in front of him. So he says, correctly, “My hat is black.”*

Most people enjoy brain teasers such as the one above. We like a challenge. We like the "aha!" moments these type of problems bring. We have crossword or sudoku puzzles to pass the time when we are bored because working your brain focuses your attention and makes you forget, even for a moment, anything else going on.

I have always loved problem solving. The process of following logic and eliminating possiblites until you arrive at a solution is one of my favorite things. I love strategy games. I play Magic: the Gathering competitively because your problem solving and critical thinking skills are on display every game. I have always been proficent at problem solving. I look forward to the next chance to figure out a problem, whether at work or play. 

This is why coding and development appealed so much to me. The ability to ask, "How can I make this work?", and go through, step by step, and "solve" the code to make your "problem" work is as satisfying as any brain teaser. Each task is a new problem to solve and a new "aha!" moment to be rewarded with. 

I am right at two weeks into the online web developer course, and I have enjoyed every new "problem" that Learn has thrown at me. With lots of hard work, and a little luck, I hope to continue on my path to finishing this program and becoming a brand new certified web developer!
